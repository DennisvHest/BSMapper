## The default half jump distance is 4 beats away from the player.
const DEFAULT_HALF_JUMP_DISTANCE := 4.0

## Maximum full jump distance in meters. This is an community-accepted approximation of the internal value used in Beat Saber.
const MAX_JUMP_DISTANCE_METERS := 35.998

## Minimum half jump distance to avoid reaction time being too short.
const MIN_HALF_JUMP_DISTANCE := 0.25

## Note jump speed: speed of note blocks in m/s
var njs: float = 16.0

## The offset of the DEFAULT_HALF_JUMP_DISTANCE (in beats).
## As an example, this is used by mappers to align the note jumps to the rythm of the song.
var note_jump_start_beat_offset: float = -0.15

## Beats per minute of the song
var bpm := 175

## The half jump distance (in beats) is where the notes "jump" up after which they're on their target position/speed going towards the player.

	get:
		return half_jump_distance
	set(value):

## Converts the given half jump distance (in beats) to the full jump distance in meters
func _get_jump_distance_meters(half_jump_distance: float, bpm: float, njs: float) -> float:
	var half_jump_distance_seconds = 60.0 / bpm * half_jump_distance
	return njs * 2 * half_jump_distance_seconds

## Calculates the half jump distance (in beats) of this map and applies the note jump start beat offset
## This is mimicking Beat Saber's clamping behavior â€” the game prevents the jump distance (i.e. how far away notes spawn) from going over a certain threshold, typically around 36 meters.
